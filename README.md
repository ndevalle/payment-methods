Payment Methods Component
=========================

Payment Methods Logos, Sprites and CSS sorted by countries and sizes.

So far, this is a really really early draft. 


## Stuff we need to not forget to document

- Selector contains payment_method_id from the payment_methods API
- How to generate one file with country and sizes (Grunt stuff, see with Guille)
- Explain the sizes names and which one is default
- Explain use cases
